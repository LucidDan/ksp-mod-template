## What's New

Current version: 1.0.0

This is the first release! The most significant functionality is the GitHub Actions support, something I've been working on for a while. This makes it possible for the entire plugin including the Unity assetbundle to be built via GitHub Actions. No more manual work!

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on recent changes.

* No known compatbility issues.


## Installing

The preferred way to install this mod is via CKAN, as this minimizes the chance that you will have problems with dependencies and KSP version support.

However, not everyone likes or is able to use CKAN - if not, please use the following procedure to install this mod:

1. Ensure all "Required" dependencies above are already downloaded and installed. Pay close attention to specific minimum versions of those plugins.
2. Download the ZIP from GitHub, CurseForge, or SpaceDock.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP, and copy or move the "LucidDan" folder into the "GameData" subdirectory of your KSP installation.


## Getting Support

First, if you have hit an issue, check the FAQ and Known Issues section before looking for help.

There are a few avenues available for support. In general, if you're really confident you've found a bug, log an issue directly via GitHub. If you are not quite sure or just have questions, it is best to try the KSP forum thread or discord, first. Be aware that Discord is not a real-time Q&A service, people have day jobs and have to sleep, so sometimes you might still have to wait for an answer.
